        <strong>So, what do cyber criminals want anyway?</strong>
            Most likely it is you or your company's money. 
            Not overly complicated and of course there are cases
            of exploitation for political, economic and even religious
            reasons… but often it's just plain ole' money.<br>
            In the case that you were concerned, most of these hackers 
            and hacker groups are not compromised of the sharpest tools in the shed.
            Terms like black hat hackers can sound quite intimidating.
            The truth is, in most cases, your average scammer couldn't 
            run the first line of code with a gun to their head. However, 
            they do receive code from the few that are out there exploiting
            systems with a strong knowledge base. Which means while they 
            certainly are not the best and the brightest, they still can pose 
            potentially serious threat. <br></p>
          <p class="important"> <br><br>It is important too recognize this for two reasons: <br><br><br>
                <ol>
                    <li>So, you are not too intimidated and give 
                        up before you even start. Often people get 
                        overwhelmed thinking
                        about the dangers in the cyber space… be cautious
                        not afraid.</li>
                    <li>If you know the primary motivations, it 
                        is easier to decipher what behaviors stand 
                        out in a scam. </li>
                </ol></p>
           <p> The truth of the matter is you have more control than you think. It is 
            very possible to keep yourself safe and implement simple measures to keep
            hackers at bay and your personal information safe!</p>

         <h2>Top three ways to defend yourself against cyber criminals </h2>
            <ol>
                <li class= "one">Update Device and Software</li>
                    <p>Bugs are everywhere, and this is your first line 
                        of defense! It is a common misconception that update
                        may come with more problems… it just simply isn't true.
                        Updates are there to fix unwanted issues, we will get 
                        more into this later with defining what a bug is and how
                        it works. </p>
                <li class="two">Strong Passwords</li>
                    <p>Seems like a no brainer. However, mostly out of laziness 
                        or fear of forgetting, people neglect this basic principle. 
                        Establish good password that lack a personal connection and
                        ensure they are different across the board. Write them down or 
                        put them in a secure place like a password keychain. </p>
                <li class="three">Two Factor Authentication</li>
                        <p>If not to keep hackers out then maybe to keep that 
                            ex-partner out if you happen to be unlucky enough! 
                            This is a great extra measure of security that will 
                            ensure you are padded in the case a particularly crafty 
                            hacker or ex-partner gets ahold of your passwords. </p>
            </ol>

        <h2>BIG, BAD, BUGS!</h2>
         <h3>Knowledge is Protection</h3>
            <p>Chances are if you are not a programmer then you 
                ought not be concerned with fixing bugs. Bugs occur
                often and everywhere. If humans remain imperfect then
                so too will their code. Bugs occur where mistakes 
                happen, and a cyber-criminal can exploit these mistakes.
                Furthermore, even credible sites (Google, Facebook, 
                Forbes, Twitter, etc.) are susceptible to bugs and the 
                exploitation thereof <br>
                Probably gives you a good idea of why it is 
                important to get the software update every available 
                time. Essentially there are two types of these annoying 
                little bugs. The ones that are known	and the ones 
                that are unknown. Common sense applies now. The ones <strong>known</strong> 
                are patched and the ones that are <strong>unknown</strong>are not patched.<br>
                It is best to combat bugs by just simply being aware of what they are. 
                Awareness will tell you that humans are the programmers, and humans are flawed,
                therefore programs will be flawed. Think about known and credible sites 
                like you would your own security. The amount of credible, experienced
                programmers and cyber security specialist involved in cites that are well 
                known is massive. However, much like a strong password and two factor 
                auth, these are just stronger barriers between you and criminals, 
                but there is always a possibility of an attack slipping thought the
                cracks. Bugs are inevitable until machines can do them with 100% accuracy, so 
                for now exercise caution and don't click on things you ought not to. </p>

      <h2>The Big Hazards… Social Engineering, Ransomware, DDOS attacks, Third Party Software</h2>  
        <p>These tend to blend in so bear with me a bit and pay attention. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Social Engineering</li>
            <p>Social engineering is best summarized as any attack (or malicious activity) 
                that uses the exploitation of human phycology through interaction. 
                Examples would include, but are not limited to: Baiting, 
                Scareware, Phishing, Spear Phishing, Pretexting, etc. <br>
                Social engineering makes up for a approx. 1/3 of all cyber-crime. 
                The most common are phishing and spear phishing attempts.
                It probably has already happened to you whether you fell 
                for it or not. Ever heard of the Nigerian prince that
                desperately needs the network of suburban moms' money 
                to save him from the clutches of whatever ails him or her
                at that moment. Yeah… we all have and somehow people 
                still are falling for it. This is not the only case of 
                phishing, but it is an example of phishing that we can 
                all relate to. I won't dive into everything, for a basic
                understanding, knowing what social engineering is and 
                some examples of what they are is enough for now.</p>
        <li>Ransomware</li>
            <p>Ransomware is when a hacker takes over your data, encrypts
                 that data and then gives a simple ultimatum: A. Hack me 
                 back and take back your information OR B. Give me the
                  specified amount of money or I'll give back.<br>
                  Typically, a failure to comply results in the extermination 
                  of your data or the release of such data publicly. Most of 
                  the time the sums of money are not incredibly large. As is 
                  to be expected, if most hacker are there to make money, 
                  then how in the world would you expect to do that if no one
                   could afford your ransom! Otherwise, the hacker would be 
                   spending a bunch of time hacking into people's software, 
                   getting their information, encrypting that information, 
                   then releasing or deleting all that work in the case that 
                   the ransom isn't paid. That would be a bit counter intuitive. 
                   Not those cyber criminals tend to be the best and the brightest. 
                   Know about and look out for it! Your best defense: 
                   UPDATE SYSTEM, STRONG PASSWORDS, TWO FACTOR AUTH! If I am 
                   sounding like a broken record, then that is the point!</p>
        <li>DDOS Attacks</li>
         <p>Long name is Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDOS). Essentially what 
             happens in a DDOS attack sounds dangerously close to what you would 
             expect a bad movie quote would sound like 'Flood the System! Down the Servers! 
             Overwhelm the Network!'. I picture the van guy off national treasure every time 
             I think about it. However, that is a good summary of what it is. An attempt to 
             overrun the severs with a flood of data, in order to, disrupt the normal traffic 
             a server would experience. Unfortunately, my favorite “UPDATE SYSTEM, STRONG PASSWORDS,
            TWO FACTOR AUTH!”  doesn't apply as much to this piece of information. 
            This will require the work of a professional or a savvy individual 
            who knows a thing or two about network security and bandwidth. 
            For most, its good enough to just know of the problem!</p>
        <li>Third Party Software</li>
        <p>This one is more of a warning than a specific attack. Third 
            party software is any software you download that isn't 
            organic to your operating system (OS). If windows, mac or 
            Linux didn't make the software, for example third party 
            browsers, then it is a risk of running code foreign and 
            malicious to your OS. Best defense is to be careful and 
            ensure you read the terms before accepting. If something 
            seems fishy (or phishy for my fellow nerds) then you probably 
            should NOT agree to or download that software.  </p>

        <h2>Closing Statements</h2>
            <p class= "close"> Exercise the Trust No One and Nothing strategy
                to keep you safe online. Don't place blind trust
                known sites or programs. Be wary of you online
                presence and how others observe your online 
                presence. Always assume that you are a potential target
                (because you are). Know what social engineering, 
                ransomware, DDOS attacks and third-party software risks are. 
                Knowledge is the first line of defense. Of course, remember 
                the big three: 1. Update Devices 2. Strong Passwords 3. Two 
                Factor Authorization <br>
                Say it like a mantra and then execute the safety 
                precautions properly and you will be that much further
                away from the clutches of nasty cyber criminals.<br>

                <strong>Stay safe out there!</strong></p>
