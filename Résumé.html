           <p>  Note: My experience Working as a Recon Marine provided many certifications from Freefall, Combatant dive, 
               Breaching, Winter Warfare Survival Instructor, and many others. However, these certifications have no practical value in any assignment 
               provided by the industry I am applying for. If anything it is only a testement to the mental fortitude  I possess and the 
               willingness to sacifice in order to accomplish something.

        <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>I tend to stick to the same people, or companies, for years. I much prefer consitency and loyalty to other things. 
             Things I expect from a place of work is a good work-life balence and plenty of oppertunity to learn and grow. If these two
             areas are met then I will remain content and work for several years for the same company. Currently I am a full time student
             working on both a B.S.C.S with a concentration in cyber security and a coding bootcamp through Tech Talent South.
